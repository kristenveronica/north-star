# Release Log

The deployment manifest for North Star. One row per production release. Append
newest at the top. See [release-management.md](release-management.md) for the
workflow. `verified` = smoke green at deploy; `observed` = healthy after a window
(get_advisors + get_logs). The two are distinct — see release-management.md.

| Date (UTC) | Frontend SHA | Latest migration | Edge fns deployed | Surfaces | Verified | Observed |
|------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| 2026-07-18 | 668bb3f | 0033 (prev) | **ai** (G6 refinement: deterministic effectiveSize) | edge fn | ✅ 44/44 unit; live: Scenario C (medium,4h/2active) now → **small, single call 56s (was 119s), substanceStatus ok**; Scenario E (large,24h/0active) → large/10ms, single call, ok. effectiveSize resolves size↔capacity before prompting; honest substanceStatus + gentle sizeNote. Test data cleaned. **Project-sizing problem closed** | — |
| 2026-07-18 | e6e2998 | 0033 (prev) | **ai** (G6: per-project capacity allocation + substance check) | edge fn | ✅ 41/41 unit; live scenarios via real parent JWT — same medium request → 14h/7-milestone (12h,0 active) vs 5h/4-milestone (4h,2 active); substance check fired a regeneration for the over-target case (119s vs 86s). Test data cleaned | ⏳ live: watch that tight-capacity "medium" down-shifts (G6 refinement) |
| 2026-07-18 | edc4840 | **0033_drop_preference_signals** | — | frontend + migration (drop) | ✅ code strip deployed BEFORE drop; 9 rows backfilled to Archive (project_decision/accepted, domains intact) then table dropped — 0 data lost; advisors clean (no new issues; distill_family SECURITY DEFINER is the is_family_member-gated pattern). preference_signals arc CLOSED | — |
| 2026-07-18 | 17a23f6 | 0032 (prev) | — | frontend (v2 proof) | ✅ HITL proof via real parent JWT → deployed ai fn: wrist-aware project + counterfactual (no-wrist → handsaw/timber); rubric PASS; regression fixture added; test data cleaned | — |
| 2026-07-18 | f16efa3 | 0032 (prev) | **ai** (Generation v2: server-side GenerationContext) | frontend + edge fn | ✅ deployed (401 unauth = live, verify_jwt intact); 28/28 unit; full data path Archive→distill→Understanding→GenerationContext verified on REAL prod data (science gentle-nudge + wrist→low-strain constraint + rhythm), cleaned up. First 12 LFM commits pushed to origin/main | ⏳ needs an in-app authenticated generation (human-in-loop) to observe the wrist-aware project; watch ai_usage_log + cache hits |
| 2026-07-18 | 6a89c80 | **0032_distillation** | — | migration (distill_family fn) | ✅ applied to prod; verified live (rolled back, 0 leaked): all requirement-#12 cases green — repeated→inferred (science 0.60), 1-event insufficient, no cross-child contamination, declared→immediate temp +review_at, family/child distinct, confirmed kept (0.95), contradiction kept (0.20), idempotent (3=3), outsider→42501, full path Archive→distill→assembleUnderstanding=3 active | ⏳ live: not auto-invoked yet (G3); backfill not run (G5) |
| 2026-07-18 | ca0ec2e | 0031 (prev) | — | frontend (write path 2+3) | ✅ 18/18 unit; project accept/edit/decline + milestone/project completion → Archive; last preference_signals writer removed | — |
| 2026-07-18 | 538cc31 | **0031_lfm_engines** | — | migration (LFM substrate) | ✅ applied to prod; verified live: 5 new `understandings` cols (provenance/surface_status/surfaced_at/noticing/review_at), `recommendations` + `reports` created, RLS on both (8 policies). Additive-only, idempotent, 0 rows affected. Extends 0027, no parallel model | ⏳ live: next step is wiring the engines (write path Archive→Understanding, then Observation/Rhythm/Generation-v2 reads) |
| 2026-07-18 | 07c3bdd | 0030 (prev) | — | frontend | ✅ smoke 9/9 — parent-portal polish: child colours (calendar+projects), upcoming hides completed, editable reward rhythm, tech-page PDF/intro | — |
| 2026-07-18 | c86ac0f | **0030_fix_children_select_rls** | — | migration (RLS) | ✅ CRITICAL fix: children SELECT policy blocked INSERT…RETURNING (STABLE self-ref) → no family synced. Inlined check; isolation preserved | ✅ Ivany family fully synced: 2 children, 2 projects, 15 milestones, video pointer linked to storage |
| 2026-07-17 | 4f1da6c | **0029_family_media_storage** | — | frontend + migration + Storage bucket | ✅ smoke 9/9; **cross-family isolation test passed** (A sees own=1, other=0; predicate true/false); bucket private, 50MB, 4 RLS policies | ⏳ live: needs a signed-in end-to-end upload (upload → reload → still there) |
| 2026-07-17 | 9146f9c | **0028_ai_usage_log** | **ai** (usage logging + project-prompt caching) | migration + edge fn | ✅ migration applied, fn deployed, table structurally correct (RLS on, service-role-only, ready) | ⏳ live: next `generate-project` should write a row + show `cache_read_tokens>0` on 2nd call |
| 2026-07-17 | (repo-only) | 0024 recovered | — | repo reconciliation | ✅ table 37/37 + 237 cols traced; 0024 committed | ✅ no schema regressions |
| 2026-07-17 | 803ef0a | 0027_living_family_record | — (none this release) | frontend | ✅ smoke 9/9, live commit asserted; first deploy carrying build stamp | ⚠️ see RLS-denial burst note |
| 2026-07-17 | 326e296 | 0027_living_family_record | ai (Reflection engine, earlier) | frontend | ✅ smoke 7/8 (pre-build-stamp); frontend caught up to backend after 75-commit gap | ⚠️ see RLS-denial burst note |

## Notes

- **2026-07-17 — release-workflow:** introduced this log, CI, deploy-preview
  boundary, build stamp, release-check + smoke-test. First release to carry a
  `build-info.json` deploy stamp.
- **2026-07-17 — frontend catch-up:** `sprint-1-security` (75 commits: Epics A & B,
  access-code redesign, LFM migration 0027, DIY/gender UI) fast-forwarded to `main`
  and deployed, resolving a split-brain where prod backend (migration 0027 + `ai`
  function) had been deployed ahead of the served frontend. The incident that
  motivated this workflow.
- **2026-07-17 — reconciliation:** migration `0024` recovered from prod and
  committed; repo↔prod schema alignment verified (37/37 tables, 237 columns traced).
  Stray duplicate Netlify site `incandescent-babka-30ebd3` deleted — single
  production target (`north-star-discovery` → northstar-family.com), previews intact.
  Added the `observed` release stage and the authoritative-repository rule.
- **Observed — RLS-denial burst (2026-07-17, ~30–40 min after the frontend deploy).**
  Postgres logs showed a cluster of ~40 `ERROR`s: RLS-policy denials on `children`,
  `projects`, `milestones`, `materials`, plus `preference_signals` FK violations —
  all in write-dependency order, i.e. one flow trying to persist a whole family
  dataset and being rejected at each step. **Not data loss:** no row landed (latest
  successful write to those tables is 2026-07-06 or earlier; the 3 existing families'
  data is intact). Diagnosis: the app's "seed sample data → sync" path ran under a
  session not authorised for the target family (most likely a fresh/logged-out load
  of the newly-deployed site) and RLS correctly denied every write. **Risk: none to
  data integrity.** Open question: confirm this was a test/fresh-session load and not
  a real onboarding flow silently failing to save — a client should not be attempting
  writes it isn't allowed to make. Tracked as a UX/robustness item, not a launch blocker.
- **Advisors (2026-07-17):** all pre-existing, none introduced by today's releases.
  `security_events` RLS-enabled-no-policy is deny-all-by-design (audit log). The
  SECURITY DEFINER `anon`-EXECUTE warnings on trigger functions (`apply_billing_entitlement`,
  `enforce_*`) are non-exploitable — they reference `NEW` and error outside trigger
  context. Genuine cheap hardening: enable Auth leaked-password protection. Perf lints
  (unindexed FKs, RLS initplan) are immaterial at beta scale. See
  [[north-star-phase0-security]].
